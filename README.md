# Vehicle_detection_classification_and_counting_using_YOLOv5
### The project is to develop a real-time vehicle detection and counting system for video analytics applications using YOLOv5 model. This system aims to accurately identify and track cars in a video stream, differentiate between their movement directions, take the count of cars moving in different directions.
